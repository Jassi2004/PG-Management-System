Absolutely! Let's first break down the schema carefully based on the requirements we discussed, without jumping into code. We'll focus on the **fields** that need to be stored for each model.

### 1. **Tenant Schema**
The tenant schema will hold all the details related to the tenants, including their personal information, rent, and any balance due.

#### **Fields for Tenant Schema**:
- **name** (String, required): Tenant's full name.
- **phoneNumber** (String, required): Tenant's contact number.
- **dateOfJoining** (Date, required): Date the tenant moved into the PG.
- **roomNumber** (String, optional): The room number assigned to the tenant.
- **monthlyRent** (Number, required): The fixed monthly rent amount.
- **balanceDue** (Number, default = 0): Running total of what the tenant owes, including rent, food, and utility charges.
- **isActive** (Boolean, default = true): To track if the tenant is still living in the PG.

  - **amount** (Number): Amount paid.
  - **method** (String): Mode of payment (cash, bank transfer, etc.).

### 2. **Food Record Schema**
The food record will log each instance when a tenant is served food, and it will add up for monthly billing.

#### **Fields for Food Record Schema**:
- **tenantId** (Reference to Tenant, required): Reference to the tenant who took the food.
- **date** (Date, required): The date when the food was served.
- **mealType** (String, required): Type of meal served (e.g., "Breakfast", "Lunch", "Dinner").
- **cost** (Number, required): Cost of the meal.

### 3. **Utility Charge Schema**
This will keep track of utility bills (e.g., electricity, water) that are added to the tenant’s dues.

#### **Fields for Utility Charge Schema**:
- **tenantId** (Reference to Tenant, required): Reference to the tenant being charged.
- **date** (Date, required): Date when the utility charge is added.
- **type** (String, required): Type of utility (e.g., "Electricity", "Water").
- **amount** (Number, required): Amount being charged.

### 4. **Payment Schema**
Payments made by tenants will be recorded in this schema to keep track of dues being cleared.

#### **Fields for Payment Schema**:
- **tenantId** (Reference to Tenant, required): Reference to the tenant making the payment.
- **date** (Date, required): Date when the payment was made.
- **amount** (Number, required): The payment amount.
- **method** (String, optional): Payment method (e.g., cash, bank transfer, etc.).

### 5. **Admin Schema**
This schema is for the admin (your mother) who manages the PG. It’s optional but useful if you want to add a login system for her to manage tenants and records.

#### **Fields for Admin Schema**:
- **name** (String, required): Name of the admin (your mother).
- **email** (String, required): Admin email for login.
- **password** (String, required): Admin password for login (hashed).

### 6. **Monthly Summary Schema**
This will aggregate rent, food charges, utility charges, and payments for the monthly billing cycle.

#### **Fields for Monthly Summary Schema**:
- **tenantId** (Reference to Tenant, required): Tenant the report is for.
- **startDate** (Date, required): Start of the billing period (usually the 1st of the month).
- **endDate** (Date, required): End of the billing period (usually the last day of the month).
- **totalRent** (Number, required): Total rent for the period.
- **totalFoodCharges** (Number, required): Total food charges for the period.
- **totalUtilityCharges** (Number, required): Total utility charges for the period.
- **totalPayments** (Number, required): Total payments made during the period.
- **balanceDue** (Number, required): The total outstanding balance after calculations.

---

### **Additional Details to Consider**:

1. **Rent Calculation**:
   - Rent should automatically be added to the tenant’s balance on the 1st of every month.
   - If the tenant joins mid-month, calculate pro-rata rent based on the number of days.

2. **Food Charges**:
   - Each meal's cost should be configurable but fixed when entered.
   - Food charges are accumulated on a daily basis and reflected in the tenant’s monthly summary.

3. **Utility Charges**:
   - Utility charges may be divided equally among tenants or assigned manually based on consumption.
   - The admin should have the flexibility to apply these charges.

4. **Payment History**:
   - Payment history for each tenant will be important for tracking dues and keeping records transparent.

5. **Balance Due**:
   - This will keep track of the tenant’s outstanding balance.
   - Each tenant should have an up-to-date balance due that reflects rent, food charges, utility charges, and payments made.

### **Schema Relationships**:

- **Tenant** ↔ **Payment**: A **one-to-many relationship**, where a tenant can have multiple payment records.
- **Tenant** ↔ **Food Record**: A **one-to-many relationship**, where a tenant can have multiple food records.
- **Tenant** ↔ **Utility Charge**: A **one-to-many relationship**, where a tenant can have multiple utility charges.
- **Tenant** ↔ **Monthly Summary**: A **one-to-one relationship**, with each tenant having a summary per billing period.
